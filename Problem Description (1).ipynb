I work with the local Historical Society here in Whitby, Durham Region, Ontario, Canada. We want to put an interactive map on our website that shows the location of our museum and other museums, art galleries, and live theater venues in Durham region. This would provide these institutions, who are almost all non-profit organizations, with more exposure and allow users who have made their way to our website to find other art and culture locations in their area.  \n### The map would cover all of Durham Region. It would be interactive. Clicking on a marker on the map would provide the user with the name and address of the place, and possibly a webpage address or phone number. The markers would be colour coded for each of the three categories. There would also be points for the different communities in the region.  \n### I may need to gather the data from several places. Hopefully Foursquare will have many if not all the venues. I can also use the Durham Region website for names and addresses as well as the websites of the individual locations and art associations.
